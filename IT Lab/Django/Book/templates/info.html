    <h1>Info</h1>
    J.K. Rowling is the author of the enduringly popular, era-defining Harry Potter book series, as well as several
    stand-alone novels for adults and children, and a bestselling crime fiction series written under the pen name Robert
    Galbraith.

    The Harry Potter books have now sold over 600 million copies worldwide, been translated into 85 languages and made
    into eight blockbuster films. They continue to be discovered and loved by new generations of readers.

    Alongside the Harry Potter series, J.K. Rowling also wrote three short companion volumes for charity: Quidditch
    Through the Ages and Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, in aid of Comic Relief, and The Tales of Beedle the
    Bard, in aid of her international children's charity, Lumos. The companion books and original series are all
    available as audiobooks.

    In 2016, J.K. Rowling collaborated with playwright Jack Thorne and director John Tiffany to continue Harry's story
    in a stage play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, which opened in London, and is now thrilling audiences on four
    continents. The script book was published to mark the plays opening in 2016 and instantly topped the bestseller
    lists.

    In the same year, she made her debut as a screenwriter with the film Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.
    Inspired by the original companion volume, it was the first in a series of new adventures featuring wizarding world
    magizoologist Newt Scamander. The second, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald, was released in 2018 and the
    third, Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore was released in 2022.

    The screenplays were published to coincide with each film's release: Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them - The
    Original Screenplay (2016), Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald - The Original Screenplay (2018) and
    Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore - The Complete Screenplay (2022).
